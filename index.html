On Start 
Step one => Declare Variable: sentence_length,
Step two => Initialize sentence_length to 0
Step three => Read the imput sentence as a string that end point '.'
Step four => Iterate through each character of the sentence.

Step six => Print sentence_length
Stop 

On Start 
Step one => Declare Variable: wordCount
Step two => Intialize wordCount to 0
Step three => Read input sentence as a string that ends with point '.'
Step four => Initialize wordCount to False (this allows the variable to indicate that character 
is part of the word)
Step five => Iterate through each word of the sentence
Step six => Increment by 1 if character = ' ' wordCorrect is true else wordCorrect is false
when character ! = ''.
Step seven => print wordCount
Then Stop

On Start 
Step one => Declare vaiable: VowelCount
Step two => Initialize VowelCount
Step three => Read through input sentence as a string 
Step four => Define set of vowel (a, e, i, o, u)
Step 5 => Iterate through each character in the sentence 
Step six => If the character is vowel Increament VowelCount by 1, else iterate to the 
end of the sentence.
